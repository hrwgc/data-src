title: "CIA World Databank II"
description: "The CIA World DataBank II is a collection of world map data, consisting of vector descriptions of land outlines, rivers, and political boundaries. It was created by the U.S. government in the 1980s [**1986**]. A highly compressed binary version of the data has been available on the Internet from several sources, but the format of this data is a bit complex and not well documented except by some example C code. Given the continual increase in hard disk sizes and network bandwidth, it's not as vital now to compress the data so much, so I have created plain text versions that are easier to use."
